## ROI Calculator

### What It Does

Estimate the return on investment from adopting auto repair shop software. Compare your current manual processes against automated scheduling, digital inspections, and customer management.

### Inputs

- Current monthly appointment volume
- Average no-show rate (without reminders)
- Average repair order value
- Current administrative hours per week
- Labor rate

### Outputs

- **Revenue impact** — Additional revenue from reduced no-shows and higher ARO
- **Time savings** — Hours reclaimed from automated scheduling and reminders
- **Cost recovery** — Months to pay back software investment
- **Annual ROI** — Total dollar return in year one and year three

### Example Result

A shop with 150 appointments/month, 15% no-shows, and $320 ARO typically sees:

- **+$14,400/year** from reduced no-shows (automated reminders)
- **+$18,000/year** from higher ARO (digital inspections)
- **-12 hours/week** of administrative time saved
- **3.2-month payback** on software investment

## No-Show Rate Estimator

### What It Does

Estimate your shop's monthly revenue loss from appointment no-shows, then calculate the revenue recovery from implementing automated reminders.

### How It Works

1. Enter your monthly appointment count and average ticket
2. Select your city (uses our city-level benchmark data)
3. The tool estimates your baseline no-show rate based on local data
4. Adjust reminder settings (SMS, email, phone) to see projected recovery

### Outputs

- Monthly revenue lost to no-shows
- Annual cost of no-shows per bay
- Projected revenue recovery with automated reminders
- Break-even analysis for reminder service costs

### Open-Source Version

The no-show estimator is also available as a Python script for batch analysis across multiple locations:

```bash
pip install bookingautomotive-tools
python -m bookingautomotive_tools.no_show_estimator --city "Austin, TX" --appointments 200 --aro 350
```

## Labor Rate Comparison Tool

### What It Does

Compare your shop's labor rate against regional and national benchmarks. See how your rate stacks up by shop type, specialization, and city.

### Data Sources

- 2026 national labor rate benchmarks (400+ shops)
- Regional adjustment factors (cost of living, market competition)
- Shop type multipliers (general vs. specialty vs. dealer)
- Digital inspection premium factor (+15–25% for shops with DVI)

### How to Use

1. Enter your current labor rate
2. Select your city and state
3. Choose your shop type (general, specialty, fleet, etc.)
4. Indicate whether you use digital inspections

The tool returns:

- Your percentile rank nationally
- Your percentile rank in your region
- Suggested rate range based on your profile
- Estimated revenue impact of adjusting to the suggested range

### Example

> A general repair shop in Denver charging $105/hour with digital inspections ranks in the **45th percentile nationally** and **38th percentile regionally**. The tool suggests a range of $115–$125/hour, which would increase annual revenue by approximately **$42,000** (assuming 2,000 billable hours/year).

## Bay Utilization Calculator

### What It Does

Measure how effectively you're using your service bays. Calculate current utilization, identify scheduling gaps, and find the right number of daily appointments to maximize revenue without overloading technicians.

### Inputs

- Number of service bays
- Operating hours per day
- Average time per repair order
- Current appointments per day
- Technician count and skill levels

### Outputs

- **Current utilization %** — Billable hours / available bay hours
- **Target appointment count** — Optimal daily appointments for your setup
- **Revenue gap** — Difference between current and optimal utilization
- **Technician load balance** — Hours per tech at optimal load

### Benchmark Targets

| Shop Type | Target Utilization | Typical Appointment Count |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 2-bay general shop | 75–80% | 8–10/day |
| 4-bay general shop | 78–82% | 14–18/day |
| 6-bay multi-service | 80–85% | 20–26/day |
| Specialty / high-complexity | 70–75% | 6–8/day |

## Appointment Capacity Planner

### What It Does

Plan technician hiring and bay expansion based on demand trends. Forecast when you'll hit capacity constraints and what the financial impact of adding capacity would be.

### Inputs

- Monthly appointment growth rate (historical)
- Current capacity (bays × hours × efficiency)
- Average revenue per appointment
- Cost of adding a bay or technician

### Outputs

- **Capacity forecast** — Months until you hit 90% utilization
- **Break-even analysis** — Months to pay back a new bay or technician hire
- **Revenue ceiling** — Maximum revenue at current capacity
- **Optimal expansion timing** — When to add capacity before losing revenue

## Declined Work Revenue Calculator

### What It Does

Quantify the hidden revenue in your declined work. Calculate how much revenue you could recover with a systematic follow-up process.

### Industry Benchmark

- Average shop declines **$8,500–$12,000** in recommended work per month
- Shops with 30-day follow-up recover **35%** of declined work on average
- Shops without follow-up recover **8%** (mostly when the customer returns for the same symptom)

### Calculator Inputs

- Monthly declined work dollar amount
- Follow-up method (phone, SMS, email, none)
- Follow-up timing (same day, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days)

### Output

- Projected monthly recovery
- Annual revenue impact
- Recommended follow-up cadence based on your data

## EV Service Readiness Scorecard

### What It Does

Assess your shop's readiness for EV service. Score your tooling, training, and infrastructure against what's needed to capture the growing EV maintenance market.

### Scoring Categories

| Category | Weight | Key Questions |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Safety Equipment | 25% | High-voltage gloves, insulated tools, lift isolation |
| Diagnostic Equipment | 25% | EV-specific scan tools, battery analyzers, thermal imaging |
| Technician Training | 25% | ASE EV certification, OEM training completion |
| Service Bay Setup | 15% | Dedicated EV bay, charging infrastructure, fire suppression |
| Marketing & Customer Education | 10% | EV service pages, customer communication materials |

### Result Interpretation

- **80–100:** Ready for full EV service — start marketing today
- **60–79:** Partially ready — focus on the lowest-scoring categories
- **40–59:** Early stage — invest in safety and training first
- **Below 40:** Not ready — begin with basic EV maintenance (tires, fluids, 12V battery)
